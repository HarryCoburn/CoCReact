# Corruption of Champions (Push Button RPG) Engine In React

## Description

Corruption of Champions (CoC) is an infamous Flash erotic RPG that had a rather interesting, if badly coded in places, push-button RPG engine. Since Flash is a dead language, I wanted to try to remake the engine in React/Redux and make it better.

The goal of the project is to make something that others can use so they can make their own push-button RPGs.

THIS IS NOT A CoC PORT. However, if this engine gets good enough I may fork it into a new repository and pull over the parts of CoC I like.

Needless to say, the content of these files may be NSFW!

## Installation

1. You will need NPM installed first.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Go into the directory and run `npm install`.
4. When it finishes, run `npm start` to start the demo.

The engine is based on create-react-app and is currently in development mode. There is also vscode configuration information and plenty of eslint/prettier/testing fun.

## Contributing

React/Redux/JS devs welcome. I'm still pretty new to it but things are looking good to my eyes. It's currently in very early alpha, so things may change radically as I pull in mechanics from CoC into the engine.
